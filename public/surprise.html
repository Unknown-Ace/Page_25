        <h2>Happiest 17th Birthday Leishaa ðŸŽ‰ðŸ§¿</h2>
        <p>Different year the same us. No matter how things go how much time passes our bond is that one constant that never fails or falls and I cherish it beyond time. You have always proven to me that you will always be there for me be it at day or at night whenever I needed you and I hope I can always do the same. Our every night calls or random day calls or just some silent time together it's always the best part of my day (ofc except when I get to see you this becomes 1st and that 2nd hehe) always making me laugh and feel better even when I was feeling so low that I wanted to shut everything off. I appreciate you so much as a friend that I can't even express it all, you mean a lot to me and I care about you always. Our late night talks when one of us got sad or the random kalesh it is all just part of a really beautiful journey with you and I hope that journey lasts forever. I hope you like this hehe, I will never leave you alone and you won't get rid of me that easily haha. It's your day enjoy it to the fullest and don't let anyone make u feel like you aren't worth it because Leishaa Shukla you are worth everything and you deserve everything ðŸ«‚. Have the best day of your year (because I pray you have even better next year hehe) ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰âœ¨.                    You are the best person around and genuinely the sweetest and kindest soul never change that :)</p>
